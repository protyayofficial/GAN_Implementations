# GAN Architectures Implementation

Welcome to the GAN Architectures Implementation repository! This project provides implementations of various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch. GANs are a class of deep learning models that consist of a generator and a discriminator network that compete with each other, resulting in high-quality generated data.

## Project Overview

This repository includes implementations of several GAN architectures. Each architecture has been implemented in a modular and extensible manner, allowing for easy experimentation and comparison.

## Included Architectures

- **[Vanilla GAN](./AdversarialNets.py)**: A basic GAN model as introduced by Goodfellow et al. in their original paper.
<!-- - **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**: An improvement over the vanilla GAN by using convolutional layers, which helps in generating more realistic images.
<!-- - **Conditional GAN (cGAN)**: A GAN variant where the generator and discriminator receive additional information (e.g., class labels) to condition the generation process.
- **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)**: An alternative to the traditional GANs that uses the Wasserstein distance to improve training stability and the quality of generated samples.
- **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)**: An enhanced version of WGAN that includes a gradient penalty term to further stabilize the training process.
- **Least Squares GAN (LSGAN)**: A GAN variant that uses least squares loss instead of binary cross-entropy, aiming to address some of the issues with vanishing gradients. -->
- More architectures to be included soon...

## Motivation
As a passionate enthusiast of Computer Vision, I have always been fascinated by the field’s potential to transform how machines perceive and interact with the world. The ability to enable computers to understand and generate visual content opens up countless possibilities for innovation across various domains, from healthcare to entertainment.

My journey into Computer Vision began with a deep curiosity about how algorithms can interpret complex visual data and create new, realistic imagery from scratch. This curiosity has driven me to explore various aspects of the field, including image classification, object detection, and now, image colorization. Each project has deepened my appreciation for the intricate interplay between data, algorithms, and creativity.

The goal of this project is to develop and refine Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image colorization, leveraging their power to generate photorealistic colored images from grayscale inputs. By implementing and experimenting with different GAN architectures, I aim to push the boundaries of what’s possible in automated image colorization and contribute valuable insights to the field.

This project is a significant step towards my ambition of becoming a Computer Vision Researcher. It provides an opportunity to deepen my understanding of advanced generative models, enhance my technical skills, and contribute to the growing body of research in image generation. I am excited to continue exploring innovative solutions in Computer Vision and to contribute to the development of technologies that can profoundly impact our interaction with visual data.

## Basics of GANs
**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** are a class of machine learning frameworks introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes. The key idea is to have these two networks compete with each other, leading to improved performance and generation of high-quality data.

## How GANs Work
- **Generator**: The generator network's goal is to create synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data. It takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a data sample (e.g., an image). Initially, the generated data is not very realistic, but it improves as the generator learns to create more convincing samples.

- **Discriminator**: The discriminator network's task is to differentiate between real data (from the training set) and fake data (generated by the generator). It outputs a probability that the input data is real or fake. The discriminator is trained to maximize its accuracy in distinguishing real from fake data.

## Training Process
During training, the generator and discriminator are engaged in a two-player minimax game:

- **Generator’s Objective**: The generator aims to fool the discriminator into believing that its generated data is real. It tries to minimize the discriminator's ability to correctly classify generated data as fake.
 
- **Discriminator’s Objective**: The discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake data. It tries to maximize its accuracy in identifying which data is real and which is generated.

The training process involves:

- **Step 1**: The discriminator is trained with real data and fake data from the generator. It learns to differentiate between the two.

- **Step 2**: The generator is trained to produce data that the discriminator classifies as real. It improves by receiving feedback from the discriminator’s judgments.

Over time, both networks improve: the generator produces increasingly realistic data, and the discriminator becomes better at identifying the nuances between real and fake data. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is almost indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator cannot reliably tell the difference.

## Applications
GANs are used in various applications, including:

- Image generation and enhancement
- Style transfer
- Data augmentation
- Super-resolution
- Text-to-image synthesis

GANs have become a foundational technology in generative models and continue to be an active area of research and development.
